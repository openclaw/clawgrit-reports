#### Auth Setup

Configure the disposable OpenClaw env with Kova's mock provider auth.

Commands:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-fresh-install-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-fresh-install-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

Evidence to capture:

- OpenClaw config points to mock provider
- default agent model is openai/gpt-5.5

Results:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-fresh-install-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-fresh-install-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

#### State Setup After provision

Apply Kova state 'onboarded-user' setup after scenario phase 'provision'.

Commands:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-fresh-install-onboarded-user-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- node -e 'const fs=require("fs"), path=require("path"); const home=process.env.OPENCLAW_HOME; const dirs=["plugins",".openclaw/plugins","sessions","workspace","config"]; for (const dir of dirs) fs.mkdirSync(path.join(home,dir),{recursive:true}); const state={schemaVersion:"kova.fixture.onboarding.v1",onboarded:true,createdAt:new Date().toISOString()}; for (const rel of ["onboarding.json",".openclaw/onboarding.json","config/onboarding.json"]) fs.writeFileSync(path.join(home,rel),JSON.stringify(state,null,2));'`

Evidence to capture:

- onboarding marker files exist
- baseline user folders exist

Results:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-fresh-install-onboarded-user-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- node -e 'const fs=require("fs"), path=require("path"); const home=process.env.OPENCLAW_HOME; const dirs=["plugins",".openclaw/plugins","sessions","workspace","config"]; for (const dir of dirs) fs.mkdirSync(path.join(home,dir),{recursive:true}); const state={schemaVersion:"kova.fixture.onboarding.v1",onboarded:true,createdAt:new Date().toISOString()}; for (const rel of ["onboarding.json",".openclaw/onboarding.json","config/onboarding.json"]) fs.writeFileSync(path.join(home,rel),JSON.stringify(state,null,2));'`

#### Auth Setup

Configure the disposable OpenClaw env with Kova's mock provider auth.

Commands:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

Evidence to capture:

- OpenClaw config points to mock provider
- default agent model is openai/gpt-5.5

Results:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

#### Warm Runtime Dependency Restart

Restart with staged dependencies already present and verify no repeated expensive staging or missing dependency errors.

Commands:

- `ocm service restart 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z'`
- `ocm service status 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --json`

Evidence to capture:

- warm ready time
- dependency staging reuse
- missing dependency errors

#### Cold Runtime Dependency Start

Start a fresh env and capture bundled runtime dependency staging logs.

Commands:

- `ocm start 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --runtime 'kova-local-1783643521902' --json`

Evidence to capture:

- dependency staging duration
- installed dependency list
- missing dependency errors

Results:

- `ocm start 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --runtime 'kova-local-1783643521902' --json`

#### Auth Setup

Configure the disposable OpenClaw env with Kova's mock provider auth.

Commands:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-bundled-runtime-deps-missing-plugin-index-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

Evidence to capture:

- OpenClaw config points to mock provider
- default agent model is openai/gpt-5.5

#### Warm Restart Bundled Plugins

Restart after dependency staging should be warm and verify bundled plugin services remain healthy.

Commands:

- `ocm service restart 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z'`
- `ocm service status 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --json`
- `ocm logs 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --tail 400 --raw`

Evidence to capture:

- warm readiness
- bundled plugin reload

#### Warm Restart Bundled Plugins

Restart after dependency staging should be warm and verify bundled plugin services remain healthy.

Commands:

- `ocm service restart 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z'`
- `ocm service status 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --json`
- `ocm logs 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --tail 400 --raw`

Evidence to capture:

- warm readiness
- bundled plugin reload
- runtime dependency reuse

#### Warm Restart Bundled Plugins

Restart after dependency staging should be warm and verify bundled plugin services remain healthy.

Commands:

- `ocm service restart 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z'`
- `ocm service status 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --json`
- `ocm logs 'kova-bundled-plugin-startup-fresh-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --tail 400 --raw`

Evidence to capture:

- warm readiness
- bundled plugin reload

#### Auth Setup

Configure the disposable OpenClaw env with Kova's mock provider auth.

Commands:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

Evidence to capture:

- OpenClaw config points to mock provider
- default agent model is openai/gpt-5.5

#### Cold Agent Turn

Send the first simple message through OpenClaw's real local embedded agent CLI command in a fresh session.

Commands:

- `ocm @'kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r1-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- agent --local --agent main --session-id kova-agent-cold-warm --message 'Reply with exact ASCII text KOVA_AGENT_OK only.' --thinking off --timeout 120 --json`

Evidence to capture:

- cold command duration
- final assistant text
- mock provider request timing
- gateway health after cold turn
- role resource samples

Results:

#### Cold Agent Turn

Send the first simple message through OpenClaw's real local embedded agent CLI command in a fresh session.

Commands:

- `ocm @'kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r2-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- agent --local --agent main --session-id kova-agent-cold-warm --message 'Reply with exact ASCII text KOVA_AGENT_OK only.' --thinking off --timeout 120 --json`

Evidence to capture:

- cold command duration
- final assistant text
- mock provider request timing
- gateway health after cold turn
- role resource samples

Results:

#### Auth Setup

Configure the disposable OpenClaw env with Kova's mock provider auth.

Commands:

- `ocm env exec 'kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- 'node' '/home/runner/_work/_temp/kova-src/support/configure-openclaw-mock-auth.mjs' '--port-file' '/home/runner/_work/openclaw/openclaw/.artifacts/kova/home/mock-provider/artifacts/kova-2026-07-10T003201Z/kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z/mock-openai/port'`

Evidence to capture:

- OpenClaw config points to mock provider
- default agent model is openai/gpt-5.5

Results:

#### Cold Agent Turn

Send the first simple message through OpenClaw's real local embedded agent CLI command in a fresh session.

Commands:

- `ocm @'kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- agent --local --agent main --session-id kova-agent-cold-warm --message 'Reply with exact ASCII text KOVA_AGENT_OK only.' --thinking off --timeout 120 --json`

Evidence to capture:

- cold command duration
- final assistant text
- mock provider request timing
- gateway health after cold turn
- role resource samples

Results:

- `ocm @'kova-agent-cold-warm-message-mock-openai-provider-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- agent --local --agent main --session-id kova-agent-cold-warm --message 'Reply with exact ASCII text KOVA_AGENT_OK only.' --thinking off --timeout 120 --json`

- `ocm env exec 'kova-gateway-performance-many-bundled-plugins-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' -- node -e 'const fs=require("fs"), path=require("path"); const home=process.env.OPENCLAW_HOME; const entries=Array.from({length:80},(_,i)=>({id:`kova-bundled-${i}`,name:`kova-bundled-${i}`,source:"bundled",enabled:true,version:"0.0.0",manifest:{id:`kova-bundled-${i}`,runtimeDependencies:["zod","ws","undici","chokidar"]}})); for (const rel of ["plugins",".openclaw/plugins"]) { const dir=path.join(home,rel); fs.mkdirSync(dir,{recursive:true}); fs.writeFileSync(path.join(dir,"installs.json"), JSON.stringify({schemaVersion:"kova.fixture.plugins.v1",plugins:entries}, null, 2)); }'`

Evidence to capture:

- large plugin install index written

#### Warm Restart

Restart the gateway after runtime deps and registries are warm, then compare readiness and memory.

Commands:

- `ocm service restart 'kova-gateway-performance-many-bundled-plugins-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z'`
- `ocm service status 'kova-gateway-performance-many-bundled-plugins-r3-kova-2026-07-10t003201z' --json`

Evidence to capture:

- warm ready time
- RSS delta
- startup log delta
